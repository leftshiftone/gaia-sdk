== Authentication
Every interaction with AIOS through the SDK can be accomplished with an authenticated GaiaRef object.
Obtaining an authenticated GaiaRef is possible via the methods connect (for HMAC & JWT credentials) or login
(for username password credentials):
```javascript
const hmacCredentials = new HMACCredentials("exampleApiKey", "exampleApiSecret")
const gaiaRef = Gaia.connect("http://example.heimdall.url:8080", hmacCredentials)
```

```javascript
const credentials = new UsernamePasswordCredentials("exampleUser", "examplePassword")
const gaiaRef = Gaia.login("http://example.heimdall.url:8080", credentials)
```
